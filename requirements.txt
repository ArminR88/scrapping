# Notes (not parsed by pip):
# - After installing 'playwright', run: `python -m playwright install` to download browser binaries.
# - Selenium requires a browser/driver; webdriver-manager can auto-download drivers during runtime.
# - For lxml/building some packages in slim images you may need system build deps (libxml2-dev, libxslt-dev, build-essential) — ensure the Dockerfile installs them during pip install step.
